# AWS-Cloud-Fundamentals-Mini-Lab-Website-Hosting

This project documents a hands-on AWS lab focused on understanding core cloud services by building the foundation for hosting a simple website. The lab explores compute, storage, databases, and basic cloud access concepts using Amazon Web Services.

## Objectives
- Learn how AWS services work together to host applications
- Gain hands-on experience with core cloud infrastructure
- Understand basic cloud networking, storage, and compute concepts
- Practice connecting to and managing cloud resources via the command line

## AWS Services Used
- Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
- Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)
- Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)
- AWS IAM (Access Keys)
- AWS Management Console

## Lab Tasks Performed

### 1. AWS Account Setup
- Created and configured an AWS account
- Navigated the AWS Management Console
- Familiarized myself with AWS regions and service dashboards

### 2. EC2 Instance Deployment
- Launched an EC2 instance to act as a web server
- Selected appropriate instance type and Amazon Machine Image (AMI)
- Configured security groups to allow required network access
- Learned how EC2 provides scalable cloud compute resources

### 3. S3 Bucket Creation
- Created an S3 bucket for object storage
- Learned how S3 is used for static website hosting and asset storage
- Reviewed permissions and access considerations

### 4. IAM Access Keys
- Generated access keys for programmatic access
- Learned how access keys are used to authenticate CLI and application access
- Reviewed security best practices for credential handling

### 5. RDS Database Setup
- Created a managed RDS database instance
- Selected database engine and configuration options
- Learned how cloud-managed databases differ from self-hosted databases

### 6. EC2 Command Line Access
- Connected to the EC2 instance using the command line
- Practiced basic Linux navigation and management
- Verified server connectivity and service availability

### 7. Website Testing
- Tested website accessibility hosted on the EC2 instance
- Verified communication between compute, storage, and database components
- Confirmed successful deployment and connectivity

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Cloud infrastructure fundamentals (compute, storage, databases)
- AWS Management Console navigation
- EC2 instance deployment and access
- S3 object storage concepts
- Basic IAM credential management
- Command-line access to cloud servers
- Understanding of how web applications are hosted in the cloud

## Lessons Learned
- How cloud services integrate to support web applications
- Differences between traditional on-prem hosting and cloud infrastructure
- Importance of access control and security in cloud environments
- Foundational skills required for cloud support and IT roles
